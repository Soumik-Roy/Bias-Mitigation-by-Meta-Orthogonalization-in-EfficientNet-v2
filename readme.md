# DAI Programming Assignment 2 - Bias and Explanability

We will be looking into the works of 2 different research paper, and will try to combine the concepts of the two to mitigate bias in EfficientNet-v2 using a technique called Meta Orthogonalization.

You can find a detail description of all the tasks done in the report attached. ( ```B20AI042_DAI_Assignment_2_Report.pdf``` )

## Running the code

First navigate to the folder containing all code.

Make sure you are on the HPC GPU (if you are in IIT Jodhpur) or atleast that in your system, you have SLURM set up inorder to schedue the jobs on your GPU.

Then inorder to run the code, and reproduce all results run the below command : 
```sbatch batch_file1.sh```

## Getting the results
You can find all the results in the ```results``` directory. 

You can also find the analysis of all the work done in the report attached. ( ```B20AI042_DAI_Assignment_2_Report.pdf``` )
